# Snake-Game
# This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, developed using C++ and the MacUi library as part of a project at McMaster University. The game involves controlling a snake to collect "apples", growing in length with each apple collected, and avoiding collisions with itself or the game boundaries.
